# Welcome to official redtally support
Here you will find my official support for redtally. I develooped it durring and after my work at the east-german television crew durring my masters.
Its a small device where you can transmit tallys over long range via loraWAN-Technology. The Interfaces of this device are supported by relay closing contact and via TSL. For TSL, unconfortly supported controllers are the ross carbonite series. I planed to implement more interfaces, if the demand is there.
